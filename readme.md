# E-Complexity : Paramaterize Timeseries and Timeseries-like Data

On offer are: 
1) R-Project Markdown version of the code that is very slow but easy to understand,
2) Python implementation that can be used easily,
3) Cython routines for the sampling code.

What is left to the user is converting the epsilon-complexity results into a set of parameters via line fitting. Current research suggests that at least four parameters are needed to achieve a good fit.
